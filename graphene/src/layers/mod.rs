//! # Layers
//! A document consists of a set of [Layers](layer_info::Layer).
//! Layers allow the user to mutate part of the document while leaving the rest unchanged.
//! Graphene currently includes these different types of layers:
//! * [Folder layers](folder_layer::FolderLayer), which encapsulate sub-layers
//! * [Shape layers](shape_layer::ShapeLayer), which contain generic SVG [`<path>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path)s
//! * [Text layers](text_layer::TextLayer), which contain a description of laid out text
//! * [Image layers](image_layer::ImageLayer), which contain a bitmap image
//! * [Imaginate layers](imaginate_layer::ImaginateLayer), which contain a bitmap image generated based on a prompt and optionally the layers beneath it
//!
//! Refer to the module-level documentation for detailed information on each layer.
//!
//! ## Overlapping layers
//! Layers are rendered on top of each other.
//! When different layers overlap, they are blended together according to the [BlendMode](blend_mode::BlendMode)
//! using the CSS [`mix-blend-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) property and the layer opacity.
