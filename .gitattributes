# Requires Git to check out files with the LF (not CRLF) line endings for files it automatically recognizes as being text-based
# The `*` targets all files
# The `text=auto` makes it apply a conversion only to files detected as text-based
# The `eol=lf` sets the conversion to an LF line ending

* text=auto eol=lf

# Adds syntax highlighting to Graphite files on GitHub and minimizes diffs both locally and on GitHub
