Calling Rust and computer graphics developers: spend your summer contributing to open source and get paid by the Google Summer of Code program. We are excited to announce our first year participating as a mentoring organization in GSoC 2024. Interested prospective applicants should get involved right away and prepare proposals by the April 2 deadline.

[Graphite](/) is a new 2D graphics editor bringing a modern, nondestructive approach to creative tooling by merging both traditional raster and vector workflows with node-based compositing and procedural generation.

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), now entering its 20th year, is a worldwide program that supports students getting involved in open source software development. Like other forms of summer internships, GSoC pays a [stipend](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends) for participants to work on self-contained projects with the direction and guidance of experienced mentors. The program is directed towards university students but is open to anyone 18 and older. The [timeline's](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) start date is May 27 and most projects run for 12 weeks, but there is some flexibility towards pacing and end dates.

We are looking for reasonably experienced, self-motivated, fast-learning students who are interested in Rust and/or computer graphics (and for one project, machine learning). Full [project descriptions](/volunteer/guide/projects/student-projects/#project-idea-list) are listed and we encourage prospective applicants to reach out right away to maximize the chance of acceptance.

Additional year-round opportunities are available for student capstone or independent research projects. These are run similarly, but are also available to multi-person groups and provide academic credit instead of a stipend. To date, three were [completed](/volunteer/guide/projects/student-projects/#successful-past-projects) successfully.

It is our hope that GSoC will help Graphite grow and provide valuable learning outcomes for participants. A win-win! If this is an opportunity that's right for you, begin [getting involved](/volunteer/guide/projects/student-projects/).
