[Graphite](/), a new open source 2D procedural graphics editor, has spent Julyâ€“September building major improvements to **performance, node graph organization, nondestructive path editing, a new render engine, and more helpful nodes**, amongst over 100 other features and fixes.

This has been the most productive quarter yet in the project's three-year history. Most of our [Google Summer of Code](/blog/graphite-internships-announcing-participation-in-gsoc-2024/) student intern projects have already reached their goals, adding to the goodies included in this progress report. All Q3 2024 commits may be [viewed in this list](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/commits/master/?since=2024-07-01&until=2024-09-30) and all noteworthy changes are detailed below.

This is the third in our series of quarterly progress reports. If you missed the [first](../graphite-progress-report-q1-2024) or [second](../graphite-progress-report-q2-2024) ones, be sure to check them out as well. If you'd like to help speed up future progress, please consider [getting involved](/volunteer) with code, QA/bug testing, or art/marketing projects. [Donations](/donate) are also valued, as are [stars on GitHub](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite). Follow along and partake in our [Discord community](https://discord.graphite.rs), too.

The new *Changing Seasons* artwork shown here showcases some of the recently introduced nodes in this update. And it animates! Give it a try yourself by opening the artwork and dragging the percentage slider to morph from oak to maple leaves as the colors change.

- Simplified *Boolean Operation* node that combines the best parts of the two previous boolean node versions, letting users now convert from a stack of shape layers (of any size!) into a single resulting vector shape that's more versatile to use in both the node graph and Layers panel <small>([#1813](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/pull/1813), [#1933](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/pull/1933))</small>

Graphite will have a booth at the [Bay Area Maker Faire](https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/) **this weekend, October 18â€“20**. If you're in northern California, come visit and meet our team. We'll be located in Coal Shed 2 and plan to showcase the latest features, answer questions, teach how to use the app, get to know the maker community, and give away stickers and art postcards. We hope to see you there!

### Nodevember

We're excited to be participating in [Nodevember](https://nodevember.io/) next month! The event celebrates procedural art and design with themed prompts throughout the month. We're looking forward to seeing what the community creates with Graphite's nodes. We'll be sharing some of our favorite submissions on our social media channels. Be sure to tag `@GraphiteEditor` and use the `#MadeWithGraphite` hashtag together with `#Nodevember2024`.
