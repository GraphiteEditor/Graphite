To our European community: mark your calendars for the first official Graphite community meetup on **Friday, October 10th, 2025** in **Karlsruhe, Germany**. Meet core members of the project team and make acquaintance with your fellow Graphite enthusiasts plus Rust developers, open source contributors, and FOSS digital content creation software users.

To ensure we are prepared with enough space and food, [**please RSVP as soon as possible**](https://luma.com/d0psfopk) and remember to return to update the registration if your plans change.

We are planning to host a mix of short workshops, talks, open-ended design discussions, socializing, and show-and-tell demos (including a hands-on sneak peek of the upcoming desktop app) based on the interests of attendees. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like to present a talk or demo of how you've been using Graphite. Activities will begin at 16:00 and run until 22:00, with scheduling broken into both afternoon and evening sessions to accommodate options for earlier availability and later arrivals. The schedule of events will take a freeform "unconference" style in the afternoon followed by somewhat more structured plans in the evening. You are invited to attend all sessions or drop in for the later parts as your schedule and travel plans allow. Feel free to prepare suggestions for topics that we can jump between every half hour.

In attendance will be:

- Keavon Chambers, Graphite founder, designer, and project lead
- Dennis Kobert, technical lead and core maintainer
- Timon Schelling, developer of the Graphite desktop app
- Sebastian Sydow, contributor to Graphite's GPU infrastructure and <a href="https://rust-gpu.github.io/" target="_blank">Rust GPU</a> maintainer

We look forward to seeing you there.
