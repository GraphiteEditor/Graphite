The Graphite open source team is excited to announce the release of the alpha version of our next-generation graphics editor. This is the culmination of one year of development by our passionate and dedicated community. The alpha release, a minimum viable product vector editor web app, completes the first chapter for our project. We can't wait to now forge ahead towards additional milestones as we build a node-based procedural workflow, raster graphics compositing, a native desktop client, and further ambitions.
