There are two places to look for beginner-friendly development tasks. Usually, the best option is to select one of the many bite-sized task descriptions marked with a ‚ÄºÔ∏è reaction in the `#‚úÖcode-todo-list` channel of the [Discord server](https://discord.graphite.rs). You may also browse the [task board](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/1), which lists [beginner issues](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/6) to pick from. The Discord option usually has the more approachable tasks compared to the GitHub issues, which tend to have more variability in complexity.

If you're unsure about which task to pick, feel free to ask in the `#üìÑdevelopment` channel.

You may right click a `#‚úÖcode-todo-list` task and select "Create Thread" to ask questions and discuss your development progress. If your work doesn't correspond to a specific listed task in that channel, you can also create a thread in `#üßµtask-help` with a short, descriptive title ending with your issue or PR number.

If you're tackling a GitHub issue, please remember to comment in the issue with a link to your PR once you submit it. This is necessary because we will assign you to the issue after your PR has merged, but GitHub only allows assignments to those who have commented on the issue.
