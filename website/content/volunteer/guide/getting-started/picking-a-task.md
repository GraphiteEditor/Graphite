The [task board](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/1) provides a list of [available tasks](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/5), as well as a [beginner-friendly](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/6) subset.

If you have Rust and/or web experience, you may also pick based on:
- [Only Rust](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/5?filterQuery=status%3AShort-Term%2CMedium-Term%2CLonger-Term+label%3ARust+-label%3AWeb) tasks
- [Only web](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/5?filterQuery=status%3AShort-Term%2CMedium-Term%2CLonger-Term+label%3AWeb+-label%3ARust) tasks (HTML/CSS/TypeScript/Svelte)
- [Combined Rust and web](https://github.com/orgs/GraphiteEditor/projects/1/views/5?filterQuery=status%3AShort-Term%2CMedium-Term%2CLonger-Term+label%3ARust+label%3AWeb) tasks

Feel free to pick whatever task interests you, then comment on the issue that you would like to start. After commenting, you can dig in right away, then we will assign the issue to your GitHub user to keep the work status of tasks organized.

Writing new documentation by commenting existing code is another valuable way to contribute as you learn.
