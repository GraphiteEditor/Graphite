## Discord developer community

Join the [project's Discord server](https://discord.graphite.rs) then hop on the `#development` channel and ping @Keavon, @TrueDoctor, or @0Hypercube. The team would be delighted to help you get started by providing in-depth explanations of the code and programming assistance as you work. Please do not hesitate to reach out right away!

## Code documentation

Look out for `README.md` files in some folders of the codebase and doc comments at the top of some Rust files. The quantity of those files is limited right now, but documenting code is an excellent contribution if you wish to explain what you've learned for the sake of others, and improve your own understanding in the process.
