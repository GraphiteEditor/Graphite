This page is a work in progress. Below is an incomplete list of planned features in no particular order. Many are long-term aspirations. In the coming days, this will be sequenced into a roadmap and expanded with further details.

The current order of priorities right now begins with adding a node graph system to the existing vector editing toolset, then building a raster-based render engine. More advanced features will build off those core capabilities.

- Node graph and layer tree
- Resolution-agnostic rendering
- Procedural generation
- Capable compositing
- Constraint solver
- Advanced typesetting
- RAW photo editing
- Motion graphics and animation
- Live video compositing
- Animated SVG creation
- Physically-based painting
- HDR/WCG color handling
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Custom node scripting
- Asset manager and store
- Portable render engine
- Batch conversion and processing
- Mixed vector and raster design
- Data visualization and graph/charts
- Data-driven template replacement
- Native desktop application
- Distributed rendering system
