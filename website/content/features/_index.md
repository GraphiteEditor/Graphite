This page is a work in progress. Below is an incomplete list of planned features in no particular order. Many are long-term aspirations. In the coming days, this will be sequenced into a roadmap and expanded with further details.

Short-term feature development at a more granular level is tracked in the [Task Board](https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/projects/1) on GitHub. Check that out to see what's coming down the pipeline during monthly sprints.

The current order of priorities right now begins with adding a node graph system to the existing vector editing toolset, then building a raster-based render engine. More advanced features will build off those core capabilities.

- Node graph and layer tree
- Resolution-agnostic rendering
- Compositing engine
- Procedural generation
- Mixed vector and raster design
- RAW photo editing
- Physically-based painting
- Data viz/graph/chart creation
- Advanced typesetting
- HDR/WCG color handling
- Motion graphics and animation
- Live video compositing

- Asset manager and store
- Portable render engine
- Batch conversion and processing
- Data-driven template replacement
- Native desktop application
