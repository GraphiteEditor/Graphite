# Graphite privacy policy

<article>

The Graphite application does not require user accounts and does not collect, store, or transmit personal information. All user data is stored locally on-device and the application functions primarily offline.

The application makes limited network requests for functionality such as retrieving font metadata and checking for updates. These API requests may include basic, non-identifying technical information (such as app version and platform) to serve appropriate resources. Network requests are subject to standard server-side analytics used to operate the service, which collect only aggregated, anonymized usage statistics and are not used for tracking individual users.

Graphite does not engage in the activities of selling, sharing, or advertising with personal data. As a free and open-source software project, the application is designed with privacy as a guiding principle.
