The **menu bar** is the series of menus running across the top left of the editor's [**title bar**](../#title-bar). It provides organized access to many actions which are described on this page.

Clicking **File**, **Edit**, **Layer**, **Document**, **View**, and **Help** opens a dropdown menu with clickable actions. Pay attention to the keyboard shortcut listed on the right of each row in the dropdown menus. Learning to use them can help speed up your workflow.

The rest of this page is intended as a reference resource. Skip ahead to the next page if this is your first read-through of the manual.

## App button

The **app button** shows the [Graphite logo](/logo). Clicking it opens the Graphite website [home page](/).

## File

The **File menu** lists actions related to file handling:

| | |
|-|-|
| New… | <p>Opens the **New Document** dialog for creating a blank canvas in a new editor tab.</p><p><img src="https://static.graphite.rs/content/learn/interface/menu-bar/dialog-new-document.avif" onerror="this.onerror = null; this.src = this.src.replace('.avif', '.png')" alt="The 'New Document' dialog" /></p> |
| Open… | <p>Opens the operating system file picker dialog for selecting a `.graphite` file from disk to be opened in a new editor tab.</p> |
| Open Demo Artwork… | <p>Opens the **Demo Artwork** dialog for loading a choice of premade sample artwork files provided for you to explore. Click the button below each image to open it.</p><p><img src="https://static.graphite.rs/content/learn/interface/menu-bar/dialog-demo-artwork__2.avif" onerror="this.onerror = null; this.src = this.src.replace('.avif', '.png')" alt="The 'Demo Artwork' dialog" /></p> |
| Close | <p>Closes the active document. If it has unsaved changes (denoted by the `*` after the file name), you will be asked to save or discard the changes.</p> |
| Close All | <p>Closes all open documents. To avoid accidentally losing unsaved work, you will be asked to confirm that you want to proceed which will discard the unsaved changes in all open documents.</p> |
| Save | <p>Saves the active document by writing the `.graphite` file to disk. An operating system file download dialog may appear asking where to place it. That dialog will provide an opportunity to save over a previous version of the file, if you wish, by picking the identical name instead of saving another instance with a number after it.</p> |
| Import… | <p>Opens the operating system file picker dialog for selecting an image file from disk to be placed as a new bitmap image layer or SVG content into the active document.</p> |
| Export… | <p>Opens the **Export** dialog for saving the artwork as a *File Type* of *PNG*, *JPG*, or *SVG*. *Scale Factor* multiplies the content's document scale, so a value of 2 would export 300x400 content as 600x800 pixels. *Bounds* picks what area to render: *All Artwork* uses the bounding box of all layers, *Selection* uses the bounding box of the currently selected layers, and an *Artboard: \[Name\]* uses the bounds of that artboard. *Transparency* exports PNG or SVG files with transparency instead of the artboard background color.<br /><br /><img src="https://static.graphite.rs/content/learn/interface/menu-bar/dialog-export.avif" onerror="this.onerror = null; this.src = this.src.replace('.avif', '.png')" alt="The 'Export' dialog" /></p> |

## Edit

<p><img src="https://static.graphite.rs/content/learn/interface/menu-bar/menu-edit__2.avif" onerror="this.onerror = null; this.src = this.src.replace('.avif', '.png')" alt="The Edit menu" /></p>

The **Edit menu** lists actions related to the editing workflow:

| Copy | <p>Copies the selected layer(s) to the clipboard.</p> |
| Paste | <p>Pastes the copied layer(s) from the clipboard into the document. It will end up directly above the selected layer, or otherwise at the base of the folder structure.</p><p>In the web version of Graphite, your browser will ask for permission to read from your clipboard which you must grant; alternatively, using the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>V</kbd> (macOS: <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>V</kbd>) works without the browser needing this permission.</p> |

## Layer

<p><img src="https://static.graphite.rs/content/learn/interface/menu-bar/menu-layer__2.avif" onerror="this.onerror = null; this.src = this.src.replace('.avif', '.png')" alt="The Layer menu" /></p>

The **Layer menu** lists actions related to the layers within a document:

| New | <p>Creates a new layer in the active document. It will end up directly above the selected layer, or otherwise at the base of the folder structure.</p> |
| Select All | <p>Selects all layers and folders in the document.</p> |
| Deselect All | <p>Deselects everything in the document.</p> |
| Previous Selection | <p>Goes back to the previously selected set of layers/nodes in the selection history.</p><p>If the side of your mouse has navigation buttons, you can use the back button as a shortcut (not supported in Firefox).</p> |
| Next Selection | <p>Goes forward to the next selected set of layers/nodes in the selection history.</p><p>If the side of your mouse has navigation buttons, you can use the forward button as a shortcut (not supported in Firefox).</p> |
| Group Selected | <p>Creates a new folder in place of the selected layer(s), then moves them into that folder.</p> |
| Delete Selected | <p>Removes all selected layers and folders.</p> |
| Grab Selected | <p>Begin grabbing the selected layer(s) to translate (move) them around with your cursor's movement. Lock to an axis with <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Y</kbd> then use the number keys to type a pixel distance value. Confirm with a left click or <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Cancel with a right click or <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p> |

| Order ><br />Raise | <p>Reorders the selected layers(s) up by one in the layer stack, so any layer that was immediately above the selected layer(s) ends up immediately below.</p> |
| Order ><br />Lower | <p>Reorders the selected layers(s) down by one in the layer stack, so any layer that was immediately below the selected layer(s) ends up immediately above.</p> |
| Order ><br />Lower to Back | <p>Reorders the selected layer(s) below all others within their same folder(s), so they appear in the layer stack and render below those other layers.</p> |
