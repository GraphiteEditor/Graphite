		<h2>Available now for alpha testing.</h2>
		<p>
			One year ago, Graphite was merely an idea. Today, the first milestone of the alpha release series is available for testing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Milestone 1 focused on building an editor interface with basic vector design and illustration tools. Now the alpha release series moves toward milestone 2: developing a novel node-based
			vector graphics workflow. After that, raster graphics and more are planned in the <a href="/features">roadmap</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Features and fixes will continue rolling out every few days. Please report bugs and vote on issue prioritization <a href="https://github.com/GraphiteEditor/Graphite/projects/1">through
				GitHub</a>. While you're there, give the project a star to help grow its momentum.

				<p>When editing in Graphite, your work gets described in <em>nodes</em> within your <em>layers</em>. Their <em>parameters</em> can be altered anytime in the creative process. The

		<h2>Built for the future, powered by Rust.</h2>
		<p>
			Always on the bleeding edge and built to last— Graphite is written on a robust foundation with Rust, a modern programming language optimized for creating fast, reliable, future-proof
			software.
		</p>
		<p>
			The underlying node graph engine that computes and renders Graphite documents is called Graphene. The Graphene engine is an extension of the Rust language, acting as a system for chaining
			together modular functions into useful pipelines with GPU and parallel computation. Artists can harness these powerful capabilities directly in the Graphite editor without touching code.
			Technical artists and programmers can write reusable Rust functions to extend the capabilities of Graphite and create new nodes to share with the community.

				<h4>Announcing Graphite alpha</h4>
				<p>
					February 12, 2022. After one year of development, the volunteer Graphite team is proud to present Graphite 0.1, the minimum viable product release of the Graphite Editor. This
					milestone is only the beginning for the project— grand ambitions lie ahead as the development pace accelerates. We hope you will <a href="/contribute">join us</a> on the road to
					1.0 and beyond.
				</p>
				<p>
					This first release features the foundations of the Graphite Editor web client and simple SVG vector editing capabilities. It is presently suitable for basic vector illustration,
					although many features remain unimplemented. Upcoming major milestones on the <a href="/features">development roadmap</a> will introduce the node-based non-destructive editing
					workflow, raster graphics compositing, and a downloadable native desktop client for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
