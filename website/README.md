# Graphite Website

Graphite's website uses the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator and [NPM](https://github.com/npm/cli) for dependency resolution. You will need to install both to build the site.

## Building for Development

1. Switch to this directory from the repo root: `cd website`
2. Install the fonts: `npm run install-fonts`
3. Run `zola serve`
4. Open <http://localhost:1111/> in your browser and start coding!
