# Grid System Improvements Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Grid Origin Mode Selection**
- Added `GridOriginMode` enum with two options:
  - `Global`: Always uses the global grid origin
  - `Artboard`: Uses selected artboard origins (default behavior)

### 2. **Enhanced User Interface**
- Added **Origin Mode** selector in the grid options panel
- Users can now explicitly choose between global and artboard-based grid origins
- Includes helpful tooltips explaining each mode

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Added `optimize_grid_origins()` function to filter out duplicate or very close origins
- Prevents unnecessary grid rendering when multiple artboards are at similar positions
- Improves both grid overlay rendering and snapping performance

### 4. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Added tests for the new origin mode functionality
- Added tests for performance optimization
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing tests

## Code Changes

### Core Files Modified:
1. **`misc.rs`**: Added `GridOriginMode` enum and updated `GridSnapping` struct
2. **`grid_overlays.rs`**: Updated origin selection logic and added UI controls
3. **`grid_snapper.rs`**: Updated snapping logic to use new origin modes
4. **`GRID_ARTBOARD_ORIGINS.md`**: Updated documentation with new features

### Key Features:
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged
- **User Control**: Explicit mode selection instead of implicit behavior
- **Performance**: Automatic optimization for multiple artboards
- **Consistency**: Same origin selection logic for both rendering and snapping

## User Benefits

1. **Clear Control**: Users can explicitly choose how grids behave
2. **Flexibility**: Switch between global and artboard-specific grids as needed
3. **Performance**: Smoother experience when working with many artboards
4. **Intuitive**: Default behavior matches user expectations (artboard-based)

## Technical Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with explicit mode selection
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new origin modes in the future
3. **Performance**: Optimized for real-world usage patterns
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality

## Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)

1. **Grid Clipping**: Clip grid rendering to artboard bounds
2. **Custom Origins**: Allow users to set custom grid origins independent of artboards
3. **Grid Persistence**: Save grid origins per artboard
4. **Visual Indicators**: Show which mode is active in the UI

This implementation provides a solid foundation for advanced grid functionality while maintaining the simplicity and usability that users expect.
