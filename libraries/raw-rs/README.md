# Raw-rs

A library to extract images from camera raw files.

**WARNING**: This library is currently in-progress and not functional yet.

Raw-rs is built for the needs of [Graphite](https://graphite.rs), an open source 2D vector graphics editor. We hope it may be useful to others, but presently Graphite is its primary user. Pull requests are welcomed for new features, code cleanup, ergonomic enhancements, performance improvements, and documentation clarifications.

This library is built to extract the images from the Raw files of Sony's cameras. In the future the library will add support for all other other camera manufacturers.
