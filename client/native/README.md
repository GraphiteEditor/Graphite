# Native editor client

This will be the official desktop and web client. While the Rust GUI ecosystem is relatively immature and the Graphite project does not have the resources to make a custom GUI system that nicely supports extensions, the web frontend is the temporary official editor client. The HTML-based frontend client will be replaced by the native client compiled to WASM and running in an HTML Canvas with the WebGPU browser graphics API.
