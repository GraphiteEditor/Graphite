<h1 align="center">Redefining state-of-the-art graphics editing</h1>

**Graphite** is an in-development raster and vector graphics package that's free and open source. It is powered by a node graph compositing engine that fuses layers with nodes, providing a fully nondestructive editing experience.

Presently, Graphite is a lightweight vector graphics editor that runs in your browser. Its node-based compositor lets you apply image effects and co-create art with generative AI.

Photo editing, digital painting, desktop publishing, VFX compositing, and motion graphics are additional competencies planned on the [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) to make Graphite a highly versatile content creation tool.

Launch the latest alpha release of the [Graphite editor](https://editor.graphite.rs) and learn more at the [project website](https://graphite.rs/).

⭐ Please remember to star this project here on GitHub! ⭐
