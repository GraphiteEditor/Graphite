<h1 align="center">Redefining state-of-the-art graphics editing</h1>

Welcome to **Graphite** ‚Äì your gateway to a dynamic world of raster and vector graphics! Graphite is not just a graphics package; it's a revolution in digital art creation. Embrace the freedom of creativity with this in-development, free, and open-source tool.

## Features That Redefine Editing

Graphite is powered by a cutting-edge node graph compositing engine, transforming the way you edit graphics. Our innovative approach fuses layers seamlessly with nodes, delivering a fully nondestructive editing experience. Say goodbye to limitations and explore endless possibilities.

## Browser-Powered Vector Graphics

Experience the future of graphic design with Graphite, a lightweight vector graphics editor right in your browser. Unleash your imagination with the node-based compositor, allowing you to effortlessly apply image effects and collaborate on art with generative AI.

## Beyond Boundaries: The Graphite Roadmap

Graphite is not just limited to vector graphics. Our roadmap includes expanding its capabilities to cover photo editing, digital painting, desktop publishing, VFX compositing, and motion graphics. We're on a mission to make Graphite the go-to tool for versatile content creation.


Photo editing, digital painting, desktop publishing, VFX compositing, and motion graphics are additional competencies planned on the [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) to make Graphite a highly versatile content creation tool.
