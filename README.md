<h1 align="center">Redefining state-of-the-art graphics editing</h1>

Graphite is an in-development raster and vector 2D graphics editor that is free and open source. It is powered by a node graph compositing engine that supercharges your layer stack, providing a completely non-destructive editing experience.

Graphite is a lightweight vector graphics editor that runs in your browser. Its nascent node-based compositor lets you apply raster effects and co-create amazing art with AI in a non-destructive workflow. Fully-featured raster image editing and a native desktop application are the current focus of development and will be made available in the coming months.

Launch the latest alpha release of the [Graphite editor](https://editor.graphite.rs) and learn more on the [project website](https://graphite.rs/).
