# Your procedural toolbox for 2D content creation

**Graphite is a free, open source vector and raster graphics engine, [available now](https://editor.graphite.rs) in alpha. Get creative with a fully nondestructive editing workflow that combines layer-based compositing with node-based generative design.**

Having begun life as a vector editor, Graphite continues evolving into a generalized, all-in-one graphics toolbox that's built more like a game engine than a conventional creative app. The editor's tools wrap its node graph core, providing user-friendly workflows for vector, raster, and beyond. Photo editing, motion graphics, digital painting, desktop publishing, and VFX compositing are additional competencies on the planned [roadmap](https://graphite.rs/features/#roadmap) making Graphite into a highly versatile content creation tool.
