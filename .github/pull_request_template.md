Graphite has ZERO-TOLERANCE for contributing undisclosed AI-generated content.
If your PR involves AI, you must read our AI contribution policy (it's short):
https://graphite.art/volunteer/guide/guide/starting-a-task/ai-contribution-policy

REMEMBER:
- You are responsible for thoroughly testing the successful implementation of your changes and ensuring no obvious regressions occur.
- Egregiously dysfunctional PRs may be assumed to be undisclosed AI slop. If in doubt, ask on Discord before attempting a PR.
- You are highly recommended to include a video showing the before-and-after behavior of your changes and screenshots of any new or modified UI.
- Remember that Graphite maintains high standards for quality and the project is not a classroom for inexperienced developers to gain industry experience.
- In this PR description, reference any relevant tasks by writing "Closes", "Resolves", or "Fixes" with the issue # or the URL of a Discord message documenting the task.
- To acknowledge that you've read this, you must delete these rules and fill in the (strictly human-written) PR description in its place.
