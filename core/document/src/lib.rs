//! Graphite Document Core Library: `/core/document/`
//!
//! A stateless library for updating Graphite design document (GDD) files.
//! The official Graphite CLI and Editor Core Library are the primary users, but this library is intended to be useful
//! to any application that wants to link the library for the purpose of updating GDD files by sending edit operations.
//! Optionally depends on the Renderer Core Library if rendering is required.
